land heats faster then water thats why ocean stays cooler. air above land is hot, hot air is free it rises, goes up up, then cool heavier air from ocean jumps to take its empty place they are monsoon winds. since they arose from ocean theyve water vapour ie water that turned to gas due to sun heat. this forms clouds. when cloud is too heavy that it cannot hold the water anymore it releases it and rain pours
<br>
air always move from high pressure area to low pressure area where theres less air due to hot air rising
<br>
land heats faster and it cools faster. since land cools faster air above land is heavy this creates high pressure area. now water takes its pace to heat and cool so in winter it takes time to cool so its relatively warmer so the air above it is lighter creating low pressure area. since air moves from high pressure area to low pressure area wind blows from land to ocean

maldives got a new president that had different outlook on india. he wanted indian soldiers in maldives to leave

People elect/choose sarpanch to take decisions for them. Patwari isn't chosen by people so he can't take decision for them 
<br>
If there's money patwari cannot decide where to spend it for people. Sarpanch can
<br>
Patwari is government puppet. He gets orders from above. His work is restricted to maintaining list of owners of village land 
<br>
Even block level can't take decisions he only does what people at top tell him
<br>
Same is for ias officers. Every district is headed by ias officer. There are 11 districts in delhi so 11 ias. They can't take decision they only follow orders of cm

So at every level there's a person chosen by people through elections and a person chosen by government through exam

People cannot go to bank everytime to show their face, take money and give it to the receiver. So they wrote cheque, a letter to bank to give money to the holder of the letter

Cheque is only a letter to the bank, it's not money in itself because the giver may not have money and bank won't pay if there's no money hence cheque isn't legal tender

Decision of which area would go to india and which would go to pakistan was made by a British lawyer.
<br>
He was called from outside India so he'd not be biased towards hindu or muslim 
<br>
He divided based on census 
<br>
Majority muslim area went to pakistan majority hindu went to india but there were areas which were muslim majority but lied in centre of india and hindu majority like sindh in centre of Pakistan
<br>
First came news that Sialkot would be part of Pakistan. Hindus fear if they stay in muslim country they'll not be allowed to worship their god, they'll not be given jobs, muslims won't buy from them, won't sell to them, they'll be forced to convert and eat meat. And there were news muslims don't want hindus in their country and killing them so Hindus run. They can't take all their belongings so they take clothes, food, valuables. India is far they can't travel on foot, vehicle and train are all full. Also robbers know that people are running with their valuables so they rob people in trains and on foot. Muslims hear that hindus in india are killing their muslim relatives so they kill hindus in pakistan 
<br>
Azadi is based on partition of India, real event but characters and their experience is fictional. People were happy that British won't take decision for them anymore but now they're forced to leave their home and migrate to India. They're refugee in india 
<br>
Rawalpindi and Lahore had muslim and hindu sikh. Muslims thought if we reduce numbers of their population this area would go to pakistan so they killed 
<br>
Muslim first spread in india in 7 ce
<br>
A king of kerala went to muslim country, got influenced by them and came back muslim, built mosque in india 
<br>
King's last wish was that arabs be welcomed in India and built mosques
<br>
People didn't object out of respect because Arabs bought spices from them so they wanted their guests to be happy. It was hospitality so their guests could pray and face no inconvenience 
<br>
These arab buyers had to stay in india. They came to buy spices in india so they could sell in their country but once you come you cannot go back if weather isn't clear. Their hosts gave them place to stay and pray as hospitality 
<br>
Some arab liked india they married Hindu women and stayed here
<br>
They already knew buyers in Arab so instead of going back themselves and handling them the goods they just sent the ship back 
<br>
At first they were outsiders. We welcomed them because they came from far, bought from them so they can keep eating. Nobody knew they'd spread so much that one day they'll demand their own separate country out of land we gave to them 
<br>
Muhammad bin Qasim came to India with 6k men in 8 ce. A ship from sri lanka was going to arab but looters in sindh took all the goods then qasim attacked sindh as revenge 
<br> 
M0 is all the cash and coins supplier of money ie rbi has printed so that's money supply 
<br>
Only rbi can print/supply notes and coins 
<br>
Victor always tries to justify expansionism. Arab wrote that dahir ancestors became king through conspiracy. Arab women were going back to arab from srilanka. Sindhi looters who attacked passing ships gave a share of their loot to the sindhi king. One arab girl wrote to Hajjaj to ask for help. Arabs wouldn't attack to save one girl. To attack you need men, weapons, food to survive travel. It costs money. Hajjaj promised the caliph that they'll pay double of what is spent from loot. Muhammad bin Qasim was the commander who gave commands to army 
<br>
They defeat the king they take all his treasure. That king was going to spend on building infrastructure and giving to soldiers to protect people from looters. Temples also had money, food donated by people to be distributed to poor 
<br>
Sindh was first hindu kingdom to go under muslim rule
<br>
Muhammad died he used to tell muslim where to wage war, how to win, how to worship, he used to make rules for them. He didn't name any person who'd tell muslim what to do after his death. Muslim community chose caliph/successor. 
<br>
They chose someone whom prophet trusted, had experience and was respected by masses because otherwise they wouldn't listen to him. 
<br>
They chose abu Bakr prophet close friend
However some people thought muhammad's own blood should be his successor. His all son died, son in law was left shia said he should be the leader. Sunni said abu Bakr should be leader 
<br>
Shia made son in law their leader and they became separate  
<br>
First caliph of sunni was abu Bakr and first caliph of shia was muhammad son in law.
<br>
Sunni agreed muhammad son in law should be the khalif but much later, when he got years of experience
<br>
Shia and Sunni were still living together 
<br>
Muhammad son in law dies now sunni choose 5th caliph and shia choose his son as their leader
<br>
Umayyah had lot of money from selling goods. He also had a huge family. If war happens umayyah can call his relative men to join
<br>
Muhammad son in law dies now sufyan umayyad descendant is chosen as leader
<br>
1. He wasn't close to prophet <br>
2. Didn't have much experience <br>
3. But was chosen because he had money and family men who he could call to fight war <br>
First caliph abu bakr died naturally 
<br> 
Second caliph was killed by a slave during prayer because Caliph killed his family, took their possessions and now whatever he used to earn from working caliph took huge share of it as tax. He was immediately killed on spot 
<br>
Third chosen caliph was killed by muslims because he gave positions to his relatives 
<br>
Then muslims chose muhammad son in law as their 4th caliph.
<br>
Fitna means fire ie test of god 
<br>
3rd caliph was killed muhammad son in law is chosen as 4th caliph
<br>
aisha and 3rd caliph cousin said first punish 3rd caliph killers 
<br> 
3rd caliph killers also supported muhammad son in law becoming the caliph 
<br>
aisha suspected perhaps muhammad son in law had hand in killing of 3rd caliph so he could become caliph that's why he isn't punishing his men they suspected the killers to be his men 
<br>
Muhammad son in law wasn't killing them because he had their support 
<br>
It was difficult to identify the killers because they were all masked. Egypt muslims were involved but you cannot kill them all because not all of them would've killed 
<br>
He cannot kill people based on suspicion
<br>
When muhammad son in law didn't punish 3rd caliph killers, aisha gathered men and went to basra there her men killed the governor appointed by Muhammad son in law 
<br>
That governor and his men didn't kill 3rd caliph yet they were punished 
<br>
Ali ie muhammad son in law battle with aisha stopped. After that 3rd khalif cousin attacked him. 
<br>
When 3rd caliph cousin army reduced in numbers they put quran on their spear conveying they want fight to stop 
<br>
Ali's army couldn't attack people with quran in their hands
<br>
Kharijite were angry to stop war they believed all of 3rd caliph cousin men should be killed because they caused bloodshed 
<br>
So they killed 4th caliph 
<br>
Now leader of both sunni and shia has died 
Shias are clear they want Ali's son as their leader
<br>
Sunni are good with Ali's son becoming leader too 
<br>
Muawiya is 3rd caliph cousin who's army fought ali army, put quran on spears and because of whom ali was killed
<br>
He didn't accept ali as 4th caliph now he doesn't accept Ali's son as 5th caliph too. He was losing against ali and muawiya army had reduced in numbers. when Ali's son became 5th caliph he gathered more army. 
<br>
Ali didn't finish muawiya's army and now muawiya came back after Ali's death 
<br>
Muawiya wasn't the rightful caliph he became 6th caliph using force. Ali's son stepped down and allowed muawiya to be caliph 
<br>
Ali's son stepped down and allowed muawiya to be caliph on condition that after muawiya the next caliph will be chosen based on 3 criteria by the community, muawiya's son wouldn't become the caliph 
<br>
Shias anyway were separate because muawiya wasn't descendant of Muhammad 
<br>
So after 5th caliph, muawiya is sunni leader and Ali's son's brother is shia leader 
<br>
Ali's son brother is shia leader
<br>
After muawiya's death sunnis accepted muawiya's son as their 7th caliph even when he didn't fit 3 criteria
<br>
They were afraid if they don't and appoint another caliph then muawiya's son yazid will attack that caliph and men will die in war again 
<br>
Muslims sent letters to Ali's son brother husain that he should come and they'll fight yazid army together and make him next caliph
<br> 
When Husain came they ran away in fear of getting killed by yazid army and husain had to fight alone and was killed by yazid army 
<br>
Sunni leader is called caliph and shia leader is called imam
<br>
All imams are descendants of Muhammad. Current shia leader is also descendant of Muhammad 
<br>
Eid ul adha is celebrated because Allah replaced abraham's son with sheep/goat when he sacrificed it
<br>
Muharram is the annual anniversary of death of husain 
<br>
Husain was shia leader so they mourn his death.
<br>
Sunnis don't mourn his death because they accepted yazid as their caliph anyway 
<br>
Hasan stepped down as caliph but he remained shia leader/imam
<br>
1st imam is ali 2nd is hasan 3rd is husain
<br>
Husain became imam after hasan death
<br>
Shia sunni split because killing of husain by yazid was seen as sunni attack on shia unlike kharijite attack on Ali 
<br>
Abbasid were descendant of Muhammad's uncle. Abbasid gathered men who were unhappy with umayyad and attacked umayyad and they became next caliph 
<br>
There's no sunni caliph/one leader now but there's still shia imam/one leader 
<br>
Abbasid were defeated by mongol then there was no sunni caliph 
<br>
When ottoman said they're sunni caliph all sunni didn't follow them because by then various sunni groups had their own leaders
<br>
When umayyad were overthrown by abassid as caliph, shia didn't merge with sunni because <br>
abassid were descendant of Muhammad's uncle not Muhammad's sons/daughter 
<br>
When abassid came in power they ruled like umayyad 
<br>
Tengri means sky. Mongols used to worship sky thinking god is above 
<br>
When mongol attacked law makers and tax extractors of muslim areas they were influenced by islam and people would accept them as their ruler and not fight them as foreign invaders if they are of the same religion 
<br>
Mbq didn't convert to hinduism so Hindus pay tax to him and don't oppose his rule like mongols. Hindus were already happily paying taxes. Because he was sent by umayyad caliph. If he converts the caliph will kill him, he was under caliph not independent ruler like mongol. Hindu population didn't fight his men to take back control over tax collection and rule. He took treasure of the king and treasure of the temple 
<br>
Islam was born in 7 ce
<br>
Gond is a tribal group. Gond wana/van means forest of gond people. It was in madhya pradesh
<br>
Durgawati husband was its king, after his death she made rules, took important decisions ie where should tax money be directed until her son grows up
<br>
Akbar's men in gondwana to replace the king and take all their treasure 
<br>
She was ultimately defeated, was replaced by Akbar's puppet and their treasure was taken
<br>
Blood relatives were dangerous they had their own ambition and family members encouraging them to be next king. 
<br>
Slave boys don't have supporters wanting to see slave as a king. they felt gratitude/thanks towards the king for giving them riches when they were orphan/came from poor background. Blood relatives felt like they were entitled to everything 
<br>
Also in this way muslims didn't kill children of kuffers they attacked and kill but converted them and made them their loyal 
<br>
Rbi gets 5 cr from shareholders. It'll buy bonds, gold, give loan with that money and share profit/interest earned. It also gets money from govt and banks. 
<br>
Currency is a promissory note issued by rbi it buys assets and in turn issues currency to the seller of those assets. But the catch is those notes are never redeemed for assets 
<br>
 
Rbi buys gold with that money. Gold will go up in value would rbi share that profit 
It buys bonds and would earn interest on that Loaned money to banks would earn interest on that Keeps some money idle as cash and foreign exchange
<br>

Energy is intangible. Matter is tangible. Energy becomes quark/matter when there's too much energy 
<br>
Atom has proton, neuron and electron. Proton has the most mass. Neuron is just glue that holds protons together so they don't push each other. No of protons determine which atom it is ie 1 proton is hydrogen 
<br>
Too many neutrons suffocate the protons so it'll blast 
<br>
A small amount of mass/matter has speed of light^2 times energy stored in it. Speed of light here is multiplier
<br>
Every matter has antimatter ie for every proton, neutron, electron there's anti proton, neutron, electron. If come in contact they'll convert to energy. 
<br>
To convert all of matter/mass to energy we need to merge it with anti matter. Nuclear weapons/blast we see are nothing but matter to energy conversion just keep on adding proton/neutron and the atom will blast and release energy but it doesn't convert all mass to energy.
<br>
Energy created both matter and anti matter. Everytime energy creates matter it creates matter and anti matter.
<br>
Energy creates matter and matter creates energy.
<br>
Energy created slightly more matter than anti matter so the phrase for every matter there's anti matter isn't correct, for every matter there's slightly less antimatter. 
<br>
All anti matter merged with matter to create energy. Remaining matter formed our universe so there's no anti matter left today.
<br> 
There is anti matter world. It's tangible and look just like our world. Its atom work the same they form group of molecules, molecules arrange themselves in structures to form cells. But if water of anti matter world comes in contact with our water it'd cancel out and convert to energy 
<br>
1. Energy created slightly more matter than anti matter to cancel it out
<br>
This is baryon assymetry 
 <br>
 quarks make proton and neutron and lepton is electrons
 <br>
 luca was the ancestor of all living organisms today including amoeba. 
 <br>
 there are mainly 3 types of life. bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. this doesnt include virus because theyre non living. virus like corona multiply by giving instructions to the host cell stored in its dna.
 <br>
 if youre able to convert food you eat to energy youve metabolism. if this energy isnt used it accumulates as fat
 <br>

<br>
we don't have clean air because sellers pollute air through factory emission 
buyer and seller agree at a price but people suffer 
<br>
sometimes buyers agree to give a price because they've no choice there's only one seller 
<br>
in practical terms market is where buyer and seller gather to exchange something for a agreed price
<br>
but in economics exchange between buyer and seller should also achieve societal goals like
<br> 
 sellers should be producing what people actually need 
<br>
not harm resources in the process of producing if it happens it's a market failure 
<br>
Memorandum comes from memory which is record/storage. Data stays there. 
<br>
Article can be understood to come from particle because it means small
