<br>
air always move from high pressure area to low pressure area where theres less air due to hot air rising
<br>
land heats faster and it cools faster. since land cools faster air above land is heavy this creates high pressure area. now water takes its pace to heat and cool so in winter it takes time to cool so its relatively warmer so the air above it is lighter creating low pressure area. since air moves from high pressure area to low pressure area wind blows from land to ocean

Patwari is government puppet. He gets orders from above. His work is restricted to maintaining list of owners of village land

Same is for ias officers. Every district is headed by ias officer. There are 11 districts in delhi so 11 ias. They can't take decision they only follow orders of cm

Decision of which area would go to india and which would go to pakistan was made by a British lawyer.
<br>
He was called from outside India so he'd not be biased towards hindu or muslim 
<br>
He divided based on census 
<br>
Majority muslim area went to pakistan majority hindu went to india but there were areas which were muslim majority but lied in centre of india and hindu majority like sindh in centre of Pakistan
<br>
First came news that Sialkot would be part of Pakistan. Hindus fear if they stay in muslim country they'll not be allowed to worship their god, they'll not be given jobs, muslims won't buy from them, won't sell to them, they'll be forced to convert and eat meat. And there were news muslims don't want hindus in their country and killing them so Hindus run. They can't take all their belongings so they take clothes, food, valuables. India is far they can't travel on foot, vehicle and train are all full. Also robbers know that people are running with their valuables so they rob people in trains and on foot. Muslims hear that hindus in india are killing their muslim relatives so they kill hindus in pakistan 
<br>
Azadi is based on partition of India, real event but characters and their experience is fictional. People were happy that British won't take decision for them anymore but now they're forced to leave their home and migrate to India. They're refugee in india 
<br>
Rawalpindi and Lahore had muslim and hindu sikh. Muslims thought if we reduce numbers of their population this area would go to pakistan so they killed 
<br>
Muslim first spread in india in 7 ce
<br>
A king of kerala went to muslim country, got influenced by them and came back muslim, built mosque in india 
<br>
King's last wish was that arabs be welcomed in India and built mosques
<br>
People didn't object out of respect because Arabs bought spices from them so they wanted their guests to be happy. It was hospitality so their guests could pray and face no inconvenience 
<br>
These arab buyers had to stay in india. They came to buy spices in india so they could sell in their country but once you come you cannot go back if weather isn't clear. Their hosts gave them place to stay and pray as hospitality 
<br>
Some arab liked india they married Hindu women and stayed here
<br>
They already knew buyers in Arab so instead of going back themselves and handling them the goods they just sent the ship back 
<br>
At first they were outsiders. We welcomed them because they came from far, bought from them so they can keep eating. Nobody knew they'd spread so much that one day they'll demand their own separate country out of land we gave to them 
<br>
Muhammad bin Qasim came to India with 6k men in 8 ce. A ship from sri lanka was going to arab but looters in sindh took all the goods then qasim attacked sindh as revenge 
<br> 
M0 is all the cash and coins supplier of money ie rbi has printed so that's money supply 
<br>
Only rbi can print/supply notes and coins 
<br>
Victor always tries to justify expansionism. Arab wrote that dahir ancestors became king through conspiracy. Arab women were going back to arab from srilanka. Sindhi looters who attacked passing ships gave a share of their loot to the sindhi king. One arab girl wrote to Hajjaj to ask for help. Arabs wouldn't attack to save one girl. To attack you need men, weapons, food to survive travel. It costs money. Hajjaj promised the caliph that they'll pay double of what is spent from loot. Muhammad bin Qasim was the commander who gave commands to army 
<br>
They defeat the king they take all his treasure. That king was going to spend on building infrastructure and giving to soldiers to protect people from looters. Temples also had money, food donated by people to be distributed to poor 
<br>
Sindh was first hindu kingdom to go under muslim rule
<br>
Muhammad died he used to tell muslim where to wage war, how to win, how to worship, he used to make rules for them. He didn't name any person who'd tell muslim what to do after his death. Muslim community chose caliph/successor. 
<br>
They chose someone whom prophet trusted, had experience and was respected by masses because otherwise they wouldn't listen to him. 
<br>
They chose abu Bakr prophet close friend
However some people thought muhammad's own blood should be his successor. His all son died, son in law was left shia said he should be the leader. Sunni said abu Bakr should be leader 
<br>
Shia made son in law their leader and they became separate  
<br>
First caliph of sunni was abu Bakr and first caliph of shia was muhammad son in law.
<br>
Sunni agreed muhammad son in law should be the khalif but much later, when he got years of experience
<br>
Shia and Sunni were still living together 
<br>
Muhammad son in law dies now sunni choose 5th caliph and shia choose his son as their leader
<br>
Umayyah had lot of money from selling goods. He also had a huge family. If war happens umayyah can call his relative men to join
<br>
Muhammad son in law dies now sufyan umayyad descendant is chosen as leader
<br>
1. He wasn't close to prophet <br>
2. Didn't have much experience <br>
3. But was chosen because he had money and family men who he could call to fight war <br>
First caliph abu bakr died naturally 
<br> 
Second caliph was killed by a slave during prayer because Caliph killed his family, took their possessions and now whatever he used to earn from working caliph took huge share of it as tax. He was immediately killed on spot 
<br>
Third chosen caliph was killed by muslims because he gave positions to his relatives 
<br>
Then muslims chose muhammad son in law as their 4th caliph.
<br>
Fitna means fire ie test of god 
<br>
3rd caliph was killed muhammad son in law is chosen as 4th caliph
<br>
aisha and 3rd caliph cousin said first punish 3rd caliph killers 
<br> 
3rd caliph killers also supported muhammad son in law becoming the caliph 
<br>
aisha suspected perhaps muhammad son in law had hand in killing of 3rd caliph so he could become caliph that's why he isn't punishing his men they suspected the killers to be his men 
<br>
Muhammad son in law wasn't killing them because he had their support 
<br>
It was difficult to identify the killers because they were all masked. Egypt muslims were involved but you cannot kill them all because not all of them would've killed 
<br>
He cannot kill people based on suspicion
